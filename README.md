# STAT 4830 — Prompt Optimization Runs

This repository contains several experiment pipelines under `runs/` that share a common flow:
an adversary rewrites harmful prompts, a target model responds, and evaluation tracks ASR/refusal.
Some runs only train adversary weights, while others optimize attacker/defense prompts with GEPA.

## Submission demo

The repository includes a lightweight Colab-ready demo notebook: `demo.ipynb` (link: [colab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MMwF2ReSl52dHivvRb3DxNe3ZhAbGXGp/view?usp=sharing))

Open the notebook in Colab and run cells from top to bottom. A Colab GPU runtime is recommended for the live LoRA section.

This notebook is a stripped down version of our coevolutionary loop with tiny budgets: dataset prep, prompt-pool slicing, baseline eval, one policy-gradient finetune round for an adversary LoRA model, one dual-role GEPA-style prompt update, and final results.

## Submission paper

The repository include the final report pdf `STAT_4830_paper.pdf` for submission. The .tex file can also be found at `STAT_4830_paper.tex`.

## Project file structure

Use this map to quickly find where to work.

Core project code and launch entrypoints:
- `runs/`: experiment entry scripts (`gepa`, `coev_v2`, `coev_v2_rloo` via unified runner, `adversary`; legacy `coev_run.py` kept for reference).
- `src/`: shared library code used by all runs (data, evaluation, artifacts, runtime adapters).
- `scripts/`: convenience wrappers for unified CLI and Prime/cluster launchers.
- `configs/`: YAML config presets (`default.yaml`, `smoke.yaml`, `smoke_eval.yaml`). Shared prompts and sampling defaults live under `shared_generation` and are merged into each `runs.<name>` block when you load config (see `src/runtime/defaults.py`). `configs/prompt_reference.yaml` lists legacy prompt strings for reference only (not loaded by code).
- `data/`: local input datasets/resources used by runs.

Documentation and project context:
- `docs/`: user-facing guides, especially [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) and [Run on Prime](docs/run_on_prime_guide.md).
- `README.md`: high-level orientation and quick command reference.
- `docs/archive/`: historical branch notes and planning material kept for reference, not needed for normal execution.
- `tests/`: small **pytest** suite (no GPU): `test_shared_generation_config.py` exercises `shared_generation` merge in `src/runtime/defaults.py`; `test_policy_gradient.py` covers `src/runtime/policy_gradient.py`. Run from repo root: `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q`.
- `reports/`: course/report artifacts (for example `report.md` and presentation PDF).

Run outputs and experiment artifacts:
- `results/`: generated structured run outputs (ignored by default; keep curated summaries/figures separately).
- `outputs/`: generated model outputs, GEPA traces, vectors, and intermediate exports (ignored by default).
- `logs/`: runtime logs (currently mostly empty, may be populated by long runs).

Legacy:
- `legacy_code/`: older notebooks/prototypes kept locally for reference, ignored for final submission.

Project metadata:
- `pyproject.toml`: Python project/dependency configuration.
- `uv.lock`: locked dependency resolution for reproducible environments.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Unified runner (recommended). Sub-modes and paths: configs/default.yaml → shared_generation + runs.* → scripts.unified_runner
uv run python scripts/run_unified_experiment.py --mode gepa
uv run python scripts/run_unified_experiment.py --mode coev_v2
uv run python scripts/run_unified_experiment.py --mode coev_v2_rloo
uv run python scripts/run_unified_experiment.py --mode adversary
```

Prime/cluster launcher:

```bash
MODE=gepa bash scripts/launch_unified_prime.sh
MODE=coev_v2 bash scripts/launch_unified_prime.sh
MODE=coev_v2_rloo bash scripts/launch_unified_prime.sh
MODE=adversary bash scripts/launch_unified_prime.sh
```

## Canonical run pipeline

For consistency, run scripts follow the same high-level phase order:

1. `parse_args()` + load defaults via `load_default_config()` (`configs/default.yaml` or `PROMPT_OPT_CONFIG_PATH`), which merges `shared_generation` into each `runs.<name>` before argparse defaults are applied
2. **`patch_run_args_from_config(...)`** on active pipelines (GEPA, CoEV v2, adversary) attaches `runtime_profile`, model ids from YAML, and effective reflection URL/key (`REFLECTION_VLLM_*` env overrides) onto the argparse namespace for manifests (legacy **`coev_run.py`** wires YAML fields inline)
3. `resolve_device(...)` + build `EvaluationConfig`
4. Build long-lived sessions: **`build_vllm_stack(defaults)`** where target + reflection gateway must stay paired (GEPA, CoEV v2), or **`build_vllm_target_session`** + adversary/judge via **`RuntimeCatalog`**
5. **`OpenAIReflectionGateway.verify(...)`** uses a minimal chat completion on the configured model id (single local vLLM assumption); then optional **`smoke_test`**
6. load data via `load_harmbench_subset(...)` and slice prompts
7. baseline evaluation
8. optimization loop (or eval-only mode)
9. final evaluation
10. save artifacts + `run_manifest.json`

This is the expected shape when inspecting code in `runs/`. API details: **`src/runtime/README.md`**.

## Contributing: optional logic vs plumbing

Use this when deciding **where** a change belongs. The goal is to keep **experiment behavior** in easy-to-find places and **shared wiring** stable.

### Prefer editing here (behavior, experiments, course deliverables)

- **`runs/*.py`** — Stage schedules, argparse, training loops, when to call GEPA or policy-gradient steps, artifact paths, manifest fields. **Start here** for new run modes or different eval cadence.
- **`configs/*.yaml`** and especially **`shared_generation`** — Prompts, budgets, thresholds, dataset sizes: most changes need **no Python** if keys already map through `load_default_config()`.
- **`src/evaluators.py`**, **`src/run_pipeline.py`**, **`src/artifacts.py`** — Refusal heuristics, shared rewrite/reward helpers, CSV/plot/manifest writers used across runs.
- **`src/runtime/gepa_prompt_optimization.py`** — GEPA-specific optimization **logic** (how candidates are scored, dual-role wiring) *after* you understand how it composes with `GenerationSession` and `OpenAIReflectionGateway`.

### Treat as plumbing (wiring models, HTTP, env — change only with intent)

These files coordinate **one** vLLM URL, **one** reflection client, and **consistent** manifests across runners. Casual edits here are likely to break multiple pipelines.

- **`src/runtime/sessions.py`** — `build_vllm_target_session`, `build_vllm_stack`, `patch_run_args_from_config`, reflection URL helpers. Touch when **adding a backend** or fixing URL/env bugs, not for one-off experiment tweaks.
- **`src/runtime/openai_http.py`** — Chat client, `OpenAIReflectionGateway.verify` / `smoke_test`. Run scripts depend on stable behavior at startup.
- **`src/runtime/contracts.py`** and **`src/runtime/__init__.py`** — Public types and re-exports; renaming or reshaping types forces updates in **`runs/`** and tests.
- **`src/runtime/defaults.py`** — `shared_generation` merge and `load_default_config`; changes affect **every** run’s effective YAML.

**Rule of thumb:** If the change is “what we optimize” or “how we report results,” lean toward **`runs/`** + **config**. If it is “how HTTP talks to vLLM” or “how env overrides YAML,” it belongs in **`sessions.py`** / **`openai_http.py`** and should stay coordinated. Full module reference: **`src/runtime/README.md`**.

## Run overview

### `runs/adversary_run.py`
- Purpose: adversary-only policy-gradient fine-tuning (REINFORCE, RLOO, or rejection sampling via `--adversary-policy` / `--rs-min-successes`; no prompt optimization).
- Pipeline shape: baseline → train loop → final eval → artifacts.
- Artifacts: metrics JSON + training CSV + eval CSV + manifest (+ optional LoRA adapter save). Shared update math: `src/runtime/policy_gradient.py`.

### `runs/coev_run.py`
- Purpose: legacy CoEV runner with `reinforce`, `gepa`, or `eval` mode.
- Pipeline shape: baseline eval first, then mode-specific optimize/eval path, then manifest.
- Artifacts: mode-specific CSV logs + manifest (+ optional LoRA adapter save).

### `runs/coev_v2_run.py`
- Purpose: staged CoEV with REINFORCE or RLOO adversary updates, optional rejection sampling and multi-query rewards, named `--adversary-prompt` presets, and dual-role GEPA (`runs.coev_v2` in YAML).
- Use `--adversary-policy rloo` for the former separate RLOO entrypoint (unified runner: `--mode coev_v2_rloo`).
- Pipeline shape: baseline eval → staged training/evolution → final eval → artifact bundle.
- Artifacts: metrics JSON, comparison/trace/stage CSVs, plots, manifest (+ optional LoRA adapter save); `run_manifest.json` uses `mode` `coev_v2` or `coev_v2_rloo` by policy.

### `runs/gepa_run.py`
- Purpose: GEPA-only system prompt optimization for defense behavior.
- Pipeline shape: baseline eval -> GEPA optimization -> final eval -> artifacts.
- Artifacts: metrics JSON, baseline/optimized CSVs, optimizer trace, plots, manifest.

## Artifact generation contract

Across runs, artifacts are generated after baseline/final metrics are available:

1. build metrics payloads (baseline/final stats + run metadata)
2. write structured tables (CSV)
3. write `run_manifest.json` as the run index
4. optionally save adapters (adversary-capable runs)
5. optionally save plots/extra trace files (GEPA-focused runs)

By default, artifacts are written under each run's `--results-dir` (or config default), unless that run's config points specific files elsewhere.

## Environment notes

- HarmBench dataset loading may require Hugging Face authentication (`HF_TOKEN`).
- GEPA-based runs need an OpenAI-compatible reflection endpoint (`runtime.reflection` in config), commonly local vLLM.
- A paid external API key is not required for local vLLM with `api_key: EMPTY`.

For full setup, configuration, and troubleshooting details, see `docs/getting-started.md`.
